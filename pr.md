This website was pretty good I would say. The first thing I noticed was that the color scheme that was chosen looked nice.
It was very easy on the eyes and not just blinding contrasts. The layout was simplistic and it was never confusing about
knowing where to go next on the site. This was also helped by the header being available on all pages as well, so you
wouldn't forget what page you're on. Overall it was a nice looking and easy to navigate site.

Difference-wise, my website was centrally aligned on all of the sub pages, which I thought looked nice, but this website
didn't do that. That isn't a bad thing though, since it still looks good. Aside from that, I actually think what we made
was fairly similar. I think that is to be expected for a static site, since there's only so much that can be done.

I found the code to be well-structured and easy to follow. If I wanted to find out how to do something that he did, it
was simple to find where he coded it. On top of that, having comments in the css page was a nice touch, especially since
they can quickly become hard to read. The files are also structured pretty much exactly how it was said to do so on
the project writeup (sans the css folder, but he only had 1 css file so I don't think it was entirely needed).

The only actual issue I noticed was that there were only 4 pages of content when the writeup asked for five. Again, not huge, but noteworthy anyway. 

The CSS was handled well and there was not a lot of duplication in the files.

In general, it is a good website that shows a lot of good effort and solid understanding of what we have learned in class up to this point.
